#The find() method is similar to index(), which you already know â€“ it looks for a substring and returns the index of the first occurrence of this substring, but:

# Demonstrating the find() method:
print("Eta".find("ta"))
print("Eta".find("mma"))
#-----------------------------------------
t = 'theta'
print(t.find('eta'))
print(t.find('et'))
print(t.find('the'))
print(t.find('ha'))
#-----------------------------------------
#If you want to perform the find, not from the string's beginning, but from any position, you can use a two-parameter variant of the find() method. Look at the example:
print('kappa'.find('a', 2))
#-----------------------------------------
